jQuery Panels - 1.0
https://github.com/mstratman/jQuery-panels

DESCRIPTION
-----------
See the equation editor on mathbin.net for an example of these panels in use.

Note this expects a very particular set of html. In this example,
the "SOMETHING" should be unique for each panel, and is used as
an identifier to match the link with the panel div.

 <div id="my_panels"> <!-- your outer container that you call panels() on. -->
   <ul>
     <li><a id="trigger_SOMETHING" href="#">Desc here</a></li>
   </ul>
   <div id="panel_SOMETHING">
     contents...
   </div>
 </div>
